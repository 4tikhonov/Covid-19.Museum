# Covid-19 Museum

This is the readme of Covid-19 Museum public folder

## Introduction

**Digitally connecting data collections related to the Covid-19 pandemic
to preserve their content and realize reproducible analysis of it
through open science for the common good**

 Based on the principles of open
science, open data, and reproducible research, the Covid-19 Museum
connects digital collections housing information related to SARS-CoV-2
through software installable on any resource for archiving or
calculation. The museum’s distributed architecture ensures the
protection of the information stored within the various resources and
the additional knowledge gleaned from it. As an electronic instrument
designed to further memory, pedagogy, and research, the museum will be
available to everyone.

## A pandemic in the digital era

That the novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 produced the first
pandemic of the digital era offers the unique opportunity to trace,
understand, and compare the evolution of a disease and the corresponding
societal responses—whether personal, political, medical, or
scientific—in every country. The Covid-19 Museum is itself one such
response, aimed at providing humanity with an analytical tool
commensurate to the event. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the world
to a potential breaking point. By linking the multitude of issues the
novel coronavirus has exposed and created, the Covid-19 Museum, through
the research it encourages, can serve as a tool for reflection and
societal self- reflexivity. 

## Uniting the digital collections of Covid-19
artifacts

### How it works

The Covid-19 Museum does not itself house a collection on the pandemic,
but rather unites far-flung collections by providing access to them.
Each entity or individual that makes its digital information on Covid-19
publicly available for consultation and analysis within the framework of
the museum automatically becomes a member. The integration of these
collections is made possible through the installation of software
developed by the Covid-19 Museum Foundation ([CaMPA]), the museum’s
parent organization. 

### Construction of the museum 

The construction of the
Covid-19 Museum revolves around the manufacture of a piece, or “brick,”
of open source code that provides the interfacing software for the
collections made available by museum members and for the computing
resources provided by institutional members and by members of the
general public who agree to make their computers available when the
machines are “sleeping.” 

The deployment of the code to entities and
individuals with archiving or computing capacity serves as a foundation
for the museum’s construction, and the interface established by this
installation acts as the guard and gateway to the museum.

### Role of the interface 

The Covid-19 Museum’s interface allows the
public to consult the digital artifacts on the Covid-19 pandemic in the
collection of members in accordance with the members’ own museography
and keywords. It also offers the possibility of accessing all the
available data through museum keywords. 

The interface establishes that
through this gateway the Covid-19 Museum is operated by the actor who
deploys the piece of code and thereby offers its resources in an act of
solidarity. 

## A museum open to researches and the general public 

The
Covid-19 Museum is a tool available to and for everyone. Anybody can
consult it, but beyond that, everyone can appropriate the tools of data
science, including artificial intelligence. 

Moreover, what distinguishes
the Covid-19 Museum from other initiatives is the possibility for
researchers to file a request for access to all or part of members’
databases to extract knowledge through the means of data science
combined with those of digital science. The museum does not analyze the
collections it connects. Rather, for the common good, it provides
researchers the capability to do so in a reproducible manner while also
protecting the knowledge extracted from it. 

Peer review remains a
separate process, conducted outside the museum. 

## Why a “museum” 

The word
museum is a Latin derivation stemming from the Greek mouseion.
Translated as “seat of the Muses,” it was a place for contemplation and
philosophical thinking, like the Alexandrian Museum, the institution
built in Egypt around 280 BCE by Ptolemy I Soter that resembles today’s
universities. Ptolemy’s creation stood as an intellectual sanctuary, a
center of research with a renowned library. Many centuries later,
Europeans adopted museum to express the concept of comprehensiveness,
not a physical structure. The Covid-19 Museum seeks, in effect, to
create an electronic version of the Alexandrian Museum that focuses on
the pandemic that is today reshaping the world.
